Automating Daily Sales Reporting with AWS Lambda, SNS, and EventBridge: A Real-World Business Use Case
In today’s fast-paced business environment, timely access to accurate sales data is crucial for making informed decisions. Recently, I completed a hands-on AWS lab where I designed and implemented a serverless automated sales reporting system using AWS Lambda, SNS, and EventBridge. I want to share what I did, how I did it, and how this approach can solve common business challenges.

What I Built:
An automated daily sales report generator that extracts sales data from a database, processes it, and emails a summary report to stakeholders — all without manual intervention.

How I Did It: Step-by-Step Overview
1. Creating the Lambda Functions
I built two AWS Lambda functions using Python 3.11:
salesAnalysisReportDataExtractor: Extracts and processes data from the sales database within a secure VPC environment.


salesAnalysisReport: Formats the data and sends the sales report via email.


Key Lambda settings included configuring the VPC, subnets, and security groups to ensure secure access to the database, as well as setting appropriate memory and timeout limits for efficiency.
2. Setting Up the SNS Topic for Email Notifications
I created an Amazon SNS standard topic called SalesReportTopic to manage and deliver email notifications. I subscribed my email address to this topic to receive the reports directly in my inbox..




3. Configuring Environment Variables
To keep the Lambda functions flexible and secure, I stored the SNS topic ARN as an environment variable. This allows easy updates to the notification channel without changing code.
4. Testing the Workflow
I ran test events on the Lambda functions using default “hello world” inputs to validate that the system correctly generated and emailed reports. I troubleshoot issues such as permissions, network connectivity, and handler configuration by reviewing CloudWatch logs.


5. Scheduling the Daily Report with EventBridge
Finally, I created an Amazon EventBridge rule to trigger the salesAnalysisReport Lambda function every day at a specified time using a cron expression. The scheduling is done in UTC time, so I converted Nepal local time (NPT) to UTC to set the schedule correctly.

Real-World Business Value
This project reflects a common and powerful use case in business intelligence and operations:
Automation of manual tasks: Sales teams often spend hours generating daily or weekly reports. Automating this frees up time and reduces errors.


Timely decision-making: Scheduled, automatic report delivery ensures stakeholders get fresh data on time, improving responsiveness.


Cost efficiency: Leveraging serverless architecture with AWS Lambda and EventBridge reduces infrastructure overhead and scales automatically with demand.


Security and compliance: Running Lambda inside a VPC with private subnets and secure IAM roles ensures sensitive sales data is protected.



How You Can Apply This
Businesses across retail, e-commerce, finance, and many other sectors can implement similar automated reporting systems. By integrating AWS managed services:
You can automate reports for inventory levels, customer activity, financial summaries, and more.


Combining with other AWS services like DynamoDB, RDS, or Redshift enables flexible data storage and querying options.


Adding SNS or Amazon SES allows multi-channel notifications: email, SMS, or push notifications.



Final Thoughts
This lab was a practical dive into building a serverless data processing pipeline that combines event-driven compute, notification services, and scheduled automation. It’s a strong example of how cloud services can simplify complex business workflows while keeping security and scalability front and center.
If you’re interested in cloud automation or data-driven business solutions, I highly recommend experimenting with these AWS services.
